## Summary
**Goal:** Create a single-page, Rose Day–themed romantic website dedicated to the user’s girlfriend, with live personalization and a small interactive “moments” section.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a single-page Rose Day experience with a prominent “Happy Rose Day” headline and romantic copy addressed to the girlfriend (no login).
- Add client-side inputs for girlfriend name, sender name, and a custom message with immediate live preview and a “Reset to default” action.
- Add a “Rose Day moments” section with 3–6 clickable/tappable cards that reveal/toggle short messages and support keyboard navigation (tab + enter/space).
- Apply a cohesive romantic visual theme (colors, typography, spacing, component styling) consistently across the page, avoiding a default/template look.
- Add and reference custom generated static images (hero/illustration + decorative assets) from frontend static assets without any backend/image API.

**User-visible outcome:** The user can open a polished Rose Day page, personalize names and message with instant preview, and interact with romantic “moments” cards on both mobile and desktop.
