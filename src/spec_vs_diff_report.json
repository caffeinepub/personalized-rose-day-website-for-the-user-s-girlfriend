  "summary": "Core Rose Day single-page UI, personalization form, and interactive moments cards are implemented, with a romantic theme and keyboard-accessible interactions. However, the required generated static image assets are not present in the diff, and the diff introduces Internet Identity/auth scaffolding that is explicitly a non-goal.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Generate and add custom static images for the site (hero/illustration + small decorative assets) and render them from the frontend as static assets.",
      "reason": "Frontend references the required images via /assets/generated paths, but the diff does not show any added image files under frontend/public/assets/generated (or anywhere). Therefore the acceptance criterion that the generated images are present is not met based on the diff summary.",
